# What's new in HDRP version 13 / Unity 2022.1

This page contains an overview of new features, improvements, and issues resolved in version 12 of the High Definition Render Pipeline (HDRP), embedded in Unity 2021.2.

## Added

### HDR Output Support

HDRP 13.0 introduces support for HDR display output, including both the HDR10 and scRGB standards.

As a result, HDRP is now able to take advantage of the higher brightness contrast and wider color gamut capabilities of HDR displays.

This functionality includes a variety of customization options for adapting content for a variety of displays based on device metadata or user preferences.

For more information consult the [HDR Output](HDR-Output.md) documentation

## Updated

### Depth Of Field
HDRP version 13 includes optimizations in the physically based depth of field implementation. In particular, image regions that are out-of-focus are now computed at lower resolution, while in-focus regions retain the full resolution. For many scenes this results in significant speedup, without any visible reduction in image quality.
